About Me

Iâ€™m a problem solver who moved into coding after working in practical, hands on jobs. Right now Iâ€™m learning Python, AWS and TypeScript, and building up my backend skills with Express and MongoDB.

Some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on include:

A command line tool to seed or clear data in a local MongoDB database

An insurance recommendation app powered by generative AI

A freelance project building a website for a local restaurant

What Iâ€™m Working On

Iâ€™m taking on freelance projects while continuing to practice Testn Driven Development and containerization with Docker. Outside of coding Iâ€™m training for a half marathon in February, a marathon in May and a 100 km ultra in October.

A Few Things About Me

I bake sourdough every week.
I walked the length of Aotearoa on the Te Araroa trail.
