# Kia ora, I'm Augie Schnell

Iâ€™m a developer learning Python, AWS and TypeScript, with a focus on backend development using Express and MongoDB.

Iâ€™ve built projects like a CLI tool for MongoDB, an AI powered insurance app, and Iâ€™m currently creating a website for a local restaurant as a freelance project.

Outside of coding I bake sourdough and run as much as I can.
